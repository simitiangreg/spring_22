# Demo

This is Krikor's first repository. Exciting

## Explanation

In this repo, I will be looking to expand upon a class project in Berkeley's Data 100 class project. I took the course in Spring 2022 with Josh Hug and Lisa Yan. The project involves investigating a real estate dataset and building a classification model.
